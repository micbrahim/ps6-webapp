### Description of Data, Widgets and Panels
Like said in the General Info portion of the webapp, the Gapminder dataset contains information on life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for countries around the world. The widgets help sort the data between different regions, and the years which the data is available from. The panels help go from the general info to plots or tables to visualize the data.
